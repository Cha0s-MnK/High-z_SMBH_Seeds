# High-z-SMBHs compared with original Gao+2023

This section briefly introduces what is new in the *High-z SMBHs* project, compared with the original *Gao+2023* MSP project at `/home/subonan/Gao+2023/`. The part about MSP is totally removed here because the present project is no longer about GC-carried MSP $\gamma$-rays; instead it is being turned into a GC-to-IMBH-to-high-$z$-SMBH workflow.

## Data Downloading from Illustris

We build a totally new data access flow in folder `/lingshan/disk3/subonan/Illustris-Dark/`. *High-z-SMBHs* now has an explicit external pipeline to select, download, convert, and validate Illustris-1-Dark trees before they are fed into the model.

### 1_select_targets: select $z = 0$ MW/M31-like central haloes

This stage replaces the old static tree assumption with a reproducible target-selection step. It reads Illustris-1-Dark group catalog fields, selects candidate $z = 0$ central haloes in the desired Milky Way (MW) / M 31 mass range, and writes a stable target manifest.

### 2_download_full_trees: download full SubLink trees instead of relying on bundled samples

The second stage downloads the raw full SubLink merger trees for the selected target haloes. The API download itself is part of the maintained workflow, and the emphasis is on full trees rather than only MPB-like histories.

### 3_convert_full_trees_to_fixed_dat: convert raw trees into Gao-compatible corrected tree files

The third stage converts the downloaded HDF5 trees into the corrected fixed-tree format needed by the GC model. This workflow is clean and explicit: the converted trees live outside the repo, the header is made clear, and the resulting tree directory can be passed into the model through a flexible `--tree-dir` parameter.

### 4_validate_fixed_trees: validate tree structure before running GC physics

The fourth stage is a dedicated validation step. It checks that the converted trees have the expected schema, branch structure, and monotonicity properties before they are consumed by the GC model. The tree-making pipeline is part of the scientific workflow, so validation is first-class rather than implicit.

## Rewritten of the evolution of GCs

We totally rewrite the Fortran evolution of GCs files to Python.

### GC formation controls

The GC formation stage now exposes the model choices that were previously hard-coded in `src/main_spatial.py`. The `--metal` option selects either the original `Choksi+2018` stellar mass-metallicity relation or the updated `Chen&Gnedin2024` relation, with the same GC-to-GC metallicity scatter in both modes. The `--accreted_baryon` option selects either the default `Muratov&Gnedin2010` baryon-accretion limiter or the updated `Chen&Gnedin2023` limiter. The Schechter CIMF cutoff is now passed as `--lg_cut-off_mass`, the base-10 logarithm of the cutoff mass in solar masses.

The GC birth-radius and analytical background-radius scale no longer have to be tied directly to halo spin. The new `--eff_rad` option keeps `Gao+2023` as the default control case, while `empirical` uses the star-forming size-mass-redshift relation from `gc_birth_radius_methods.pdf` and `catalogue` uses a matched full-physics SFR-concentration sidecar with explicit empirical fallbacks.
 
### Stellar evolution

Stellar evolution is generally not changed at all physically; here we just emphasize the way we do stellar evolution again. The core mass-loss prescription is still the same age-based GC stellar-wind loss inherited from the Gao+2023 / GCevo logic, but the implementation is now in Python and coupled directly to the deposited stellar-mass bookkeeping. Another important difference from the original project is that the deposited profile now focuses on mass components relevant for NSCs and BH growth.

### Tidal disruption

Tidal disruption is now separated into configurable continuous tidal stripping and the existing direct tidal-tear criterion. The `--tidal_stripping Fragione+2019` mode keeps the current local-orbit stripping rate, while `--tidal_stripping Choksi+2018` uses a fixed `P = 0.5` Choksi-style disruption/stripping rate. The direct density-based tidal-tearing check remains unchanged in both modes. The modern solver still reads configurable tree directories and uses the input `N_s` value consistently in the Sersic background instead of hardcoding one index.

### Dynamical friction (DF)

We do the Dynamical Friction of GCs in a more efficient way. Compared with the original Gao+2023 repository, which keeps the main orbital-evolution engine in Fortran, the new Python solver uses analytical background-density evaluation, RK4 orbital decay, cleaner cosmic-time/redshift helpers, and a batch wrapper in `my/run.py` that parallelises halo evolution. The result is not a different physical idea, but a more maintainable and inspectable implementation that is easier to connect to new BH physics. The `--DF` option controls only the orbital-decay part: `--DF 1` keeps the default Gao-style dynamical-friction behaviour, while `--DF 0` disables radial inspiral for controlled comparisons.

## IMBH in GCs

We hope to connect BHs in GCs to the high-z SMBHs. This whole section is new relative to the original `/home/subonan/Gao+2023/`, which had no active IMBH module in the GC formation stage and instead focused on MSP-related observables.

### IMBH formation

We follow the paper `/home/subonan/High-z-SMBHs/my/FROST-CLUSTERS – III. Metallicity-dependent IMBH formation by runaway collisions in dense star clusters.pdf` to do IMBH formation inside each GC. Concretely, *High-z-SMBHs* adds `src/IMBH.py`, integrates the IMBH seed diagnostics into `my/plot_Kong+2026.py`, and seeds an IMBH exactly once at GC birth inside `src/main_spatial.py`. The formation catalog now stores each GC’s formation-time radius, surface density, metallicity, and IMBH seed mass, which is a major extension beyond the original Gao+2023 output schema.

### IMBH evolution

Up to now we do not evolve the IMBHs formed in GCs with accretion or BH-BH merger physics. The present implementation simply keeps the IMBH mass fixed after GC formation and carries it through the GC evolution outputs. If a GC later sinks to the centre, the sunk IMBH seeds can be summarized at halo level as a first SMBH proxy, but there is still no dedicated wanderer / post-disruption IMBH orbital module yet. This is therefore a first bridge from GC formation to high-$z$ SMBHs, not the final BH growth model.

### Kong+2026 BH mass-stellar mass diagnostic

The redshift-resolved halo summary now stores the MPB halo mass at each requested output redshift. `my/plot_Kong+2026.py` uses this run-output `M_h(z)` column for Fig. 4 before applying the SMHM conversion, so the plotted sunk-BH mass and stellar mass are evaluated at the same redshift instead of using a nearest-redshift reconstruction from the flattened tree table.
